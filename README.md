# WIP

## This repo will be merged into the parent "cambae" repo soon

## Description

This project started as all good ones do, with a little bit of alcohol and a thought "I wonder if I can automate notifications when a live streaming model is doing something _interesting_"

The result is an unholy concoction of node.js, python flask, docker, rancher, ELK
## Overall goals

- [X] Track models on cam sites, and alert when online/offline/event happens

- [X] Detect nudity using clip of webcam show, and alert

- [ ] provide web interface for managing list of models

- [ ] provide chromecast streaming features for tracked models

- [ ] god only knows what else I come up with
